== Troubleshooting the installer workflow

Prior to troubleshooting the installation environment, it is critical to understand the overall flow of the IPI installation on bare metal. The diagrams below provide a troubleshooting flow with a step-by-step breakdown for the environment.

_Workflow 1 of 4_ illustrates a troubleshooting workflow when the `install-config.yaml` file has errors or the {op-system-first} images are inaccessible.  Troubleshooting suggestions can be found at xref:ztp-for-factory-troubleshooting-install-config_{context}[Troubleshooting `install-config.yaml`].

_Workflow 3 of 4_ illustrates a troubleshooting workflow for xref:ztp-for-factory-troubleshooting-cluster-nodes-will-not-pxe_{context}[ cluster nodes that will not PXE boot]. If installing using RedFish Virtual Media, each node must meet  minimum firmware requirements for the installer to deploy the node. See *Firmware requirements for installing with virtual media* in the *Prerequisites* section for additional details.
