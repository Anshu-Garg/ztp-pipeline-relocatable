== Installation workflow


=== OpenShift Pipelines installation

First we need to install OpenShift Pipelines Operator that will be used for running the pipeline, this is achieved by using a bootstrapping script that will install the Operator and the CR to initiate the deployment.

This script will also create the required pipeline definitions and tasks.
