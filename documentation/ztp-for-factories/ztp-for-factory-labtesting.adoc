This section will cover two aspects of the testing, the HUB and the Spokes

== Hub

We internally use the files in the folder `hack/deploy` to virtually setup an environment to test the pipeline.

The first step is the `build-hub.sh` which builds the lab deployment with all the requirements (hub, DNS, PVC's, `spokes.yaml`, etc.) that will be later used with OpenShift Pipelines to perform all the tests.

== Spokes

For the spokes we use the script `build-spokes.sh`

## Usage

### Pipeline execution Hub

```sh
tkn XXXXX
```

### Pipeline execution Spoke

### Monitoring

You can follow the pipeline execution via XXXXX
